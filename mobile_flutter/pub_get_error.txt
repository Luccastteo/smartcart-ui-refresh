SLVR: Version solving took 0:00:00.950129 seconds.
    | Tried 1 solutions.
ERR : Because no versions of package_info_plus match >5.0.1 <6.0.0 and package_info_plus 5.0.1 depends on web >=0.3.0 <0.5.0, package_info_plus ^5.0.1 requires web >=0.3.0 <0.5.0.
    | And because file_picker >=8.3.3 depends on web ^1.1.0, package_info_plus ^5.0.1 is incompatible with file_picker >=8.3.3.
    | So, because mobile_flutter depends on both file_picker ^10.3.10 and package_info_plus ^5.0.1, version solving failed.
    | 
    | 
    | You can try one of the following suggestions to make the pubspec resolve:
    | * Try upgrading your constraint on package_info_plus: flutter pub add package_info_plus:^9.0.0
    | * Consider downgrading your constraint on file_picker: flutter pub add file_picker:'^8.0.0+1'

SLVR: Version solving took 0:00:00.950129 seconds.
    | Tried 1 solutions.
ERR : Because no versions of package_info_plus match >5.0.1 <6.0.0 and package_info_plus 5.0.1 depends on web >=0.3.0 <0.5.0, package_info_plus ^5.0.1 requires web >=0.3.0 <0.5.0.
    | And because file_picker >=8.3.3 depends on web ^1.1.0, package_info_plus ^5.0.1 is incompatible with file_picker >=8.3.3.
    | So, because mobile_flutter depends on both file_picker ^10.3.10 and package_info_plus ^5.0.1, version solving failed.
    | 
    | 
    | You can try one of the following suggestions to make the pubspec resolve:
    | * Try upgrading your constraint on package_info_plus: flutter pub add package_info_plus:^9.0.0
    | * Consider downgrading your constraint on file_picker: flutter pub add file_picker:'^8.0.0+1'
